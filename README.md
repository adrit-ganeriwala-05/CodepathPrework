## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Possible future ideas for this app:
- Allow the user to tap the labels to also change their colors individually.
- Add an image or animation that changes along with the background.
- Display the hex/RGB values of the color on screen.
- Change text color dynamically for contrast with background.

## Notes

Challenges encountered:
- Assistant Editor not loading initially ("No Assistant Results").
- Storyboard button connection needed to be re-established to avoid crash.
- Ensuring `@IBAction` was connected properly and not broken from the storyboard.
